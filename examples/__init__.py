"""
Example demonstrations of special relativity effects.

This package contains complete examples showing:
- Time dilation effects
- Length contraction  
- Loss of simultaneity
- Classic paradoxes (pole-in-barn, twin paradox)

Each example module contains functions that create and run simulations,
along with explanatory text about the physics being demonstrated.
